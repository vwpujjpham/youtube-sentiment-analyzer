"They learned these behaviors from watching NBA players and that is what’s wrong with the game today.   Parents have to teach these kids that they’re not in the NBA and teaching them good sportsmanship will not only help them become a better player on the court, but a better person off the court as well.   Some of these things you see in this video is disgusting and many are embarrassing.  Trash talking is part of the game but that doesn’t mean it’s personal.  I use to play with a guy who’s mouth never shut up.  He was talking shit to everyone, but the moment he fouled you hard or knocked you down, he’d pick you up, pat you on the butt then kept talking.  Now, kids take it too personal.",35,negative

"This is why sports today from 5/6 years old look and their friends and family and “so called “ coaches let them do this and got no respect for the sport and they want to make their kids that next top thing and I wouldn’t want that as a teammate, love for the game and being RESPECTFUL win or lose makes u a better person. Stop celebrating 2 points when u down 20 . People need to see it better than barking/taunting   for every single play.. 👎✌️",45,negative

"Thanks to poor parenting, and their skills at basketball, a lot of these kids act like they own the place with big pride and arrogance. Newsflash: Not very many will play in college, and fewer yet will go pro. And since they usually never try in school, they are going to be peaked in college or HS, then living with their parents all alone.",40,negative

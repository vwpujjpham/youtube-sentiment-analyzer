"I remember all of my coaches in every sport always shut down any showboating immediately.  Let the scoreboard do the talking. I have always agreed and respected the pros that just go about their business.  I haven't watched basketball in years because of exactly what this video showed. Horrible that showing up your opponent by taunting is more respected and celebrated than the talent at the sport",40,negative
"It‚Äôs the parents and coaches. I was a coach and would not tolerate any disrespect by anyone. I called out a teammate during a game we were blowing out a team. He was trying to pad his stats and I told him to stop it. I had a couple of players from the other team thank me after the game. I said, We‚Äôve all been on the winning and losing side of blowouts and running up or showing up the other team doesn‚Äôt do a thing except show you‚Äôre an ass. Basketball wise Magic was my guy, have fun but never disrespectful. Football it was Walter Payton and Barry Sanders.",28,neutral
"I'll never understand how high school basketball came to this. 'Great' players transferring to three schools in four years, playing with stacked clubs, dancing on the court, adults fighting refs, etc.",35,negative
"This is out of hand . Honestly this is a problem even outside sports , just even more visible in sports . No one , literally no one shows respect nowadays . It doesn‚Äôt matter wether you‚Äôre dealing with 5 ft 110 lb wet noodle , or someone 10 years old . \n\nI am of the opinion most of this wouldn‚Äôt be had if these kids got a ass whooping or slipper across the back of the head when and during growing up",40,negative

"They learned these behaviors from watching NBA players and that is what‚Äôs wrong with the game today.   Parents have to teach these kids that they‚Äôre not in the NBA and teaching them good sportsmanship will not only help them become a better player on the court, but a better person off the court as well.   Some of these things you see in this video is disgusting and many are embarrassing.  Trash talking is part of the game but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs personal.  I use to play with a guy who‚Äôs mouth never shut up.  He was talking shit to everyone, but the moment he fouled you hard or knocked you down, he‚Äôd pick you up, pat you on the butt then kept talking.  Now, kids take it too personal.",35,negative
"At that 30 second clip, as a varsity basketball coach it made me wince thinking about the meeting I'm going to have to have with the athletic director the next day because of it. Everyone's running lines",28,negative
"This is why sports today from 5/6 years old look and their friends and family and ‚Äúso called ‚Äú coaches let them do this and got no respect for the sport and they want to make their kids that next top thing and I wouldn‚Äôt want that as a teammate, love for the game and being RESPECTFUL win or lose makes u a better person. Stop celebrating 2 points when u down 20 . People need to see it better than barking/taunting   for every single play.. üëé‚úåÔ∏è",45,negative

"Thanks to poor parenting, and their skills at basketball, a lot of these kids act like they own the place with big pride and arrogance. Newsflash: Not very many will play in college, and fewer yet will go pro. And since they usually never try in school, they are going to be peaked in college or HS, then living with their parents all alone.",40,negative
